        name: 'Amanda Meyer',
        role: 'Improvement Advisor',
        company: 'Amanda Meyer Improvement Consulting',
        description: `As an improvement advisor, my superpower is making the big ideas of continuous improvement relevant, accessible, and useful to practitioners.

I partner with schools, districts, and youth-facing non-profit organizations committed to redesigning systems in service of providing a truly excellent education to all children. My collaborators and I bring equity values to life in everyday practice through understanding variation in data, improving processes, learning through inquiry & iteration, and navigating the human side of change.

I design and facilitate engaging professional learning; contribute to the strategic development and management of large cross-school networks; and serve as an improvement coach to individuals and teams. A strength is my ability to weave my theoretical background on continuous improvement with my practical knowledge of what will work for educators on the ground. In my practice, I create scaffolds, templates, and concrete examples to support practitioners in using improvement methods.

I believe continuous improvement provides ways of working together that can help us bring our equity visions to life in organizations. However, I believe that lasting change in practice is impossible without deep, internal work around oneâ€™s own ways of thinking, being, and relating. I infuse explicit attention to issues of identity, power, bias, and privilege in improvement work, with the goal of interrupting reproductive patterns of thought and discourse that prevent teams from achieving equitable results. In service of this, I also regularly reflect on my own identities as a cis-gendered, able-bodied, white woman, and how the identities I hold impact my work and relationships with others. `,
