            <Paragraph>
                In the pursuit of improved student outcomes, schools continuously seek strategies that have the
                greatest impact on learning. <ArticleLink href={'https://www.visiblelearningmetax.com/influences/view/collective_teacher_efficacy'}>Research by John Hattie</ArticleLink> has identified Collective Teacher Efficacy
                (CTE) as the most influential factor in student achievement, with an effect size of
                1.57—significantly higher than many other educational interventions. When teachers share the
                belief that their collective efforts can lead to meaningful student success, schools see enhanced
                collaboration, higher expectations, and stronger instructional practices. By integrating CTE with
                continuous improvement efforts, schools can create a culture where both educators and
                students thrive.

            <Paragraph inline>
                Collective Teacher Efficacy is the shared conviction among educators that, together, they can
                positively impact student learning. This belief leads to:

            <ul>
                <LIParagraph>
                    <strong>Greater Collaboration</strong> – Teachers engage in meaningful discussions, share strategies,

                <LIParagraph>
                    <strong>A Positive School Culture</strong> – Schools with high CTE foster trust, shared leadership, and
                    a commitment to continuous growth.

                To fully leverage Collective Teacher Efficacy, schools must align it with structured continuous

            </Header>
            <Paragraph>
                By embedding Collective Teacher Efficacy into continuous improvement efforts, schools can
                create sustainable, high-impact change. When educators believe in their collective ability to
                drive student success—and have the structures in place to support this belief—schools become
                environments of innovation, collaboration, and excellence. Prioritizing teacher collaboration,
                data-driven decisions, and a growth mindset ensures that all students receive the education
                they deserve.
